                       <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
                            mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family
                             Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to 
                             distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] A
                              cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; 
                              the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.[5] Domestic
                               cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability 
                               to hunt rodents. About 60 
                           cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.[6]  </p>
